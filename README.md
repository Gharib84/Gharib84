# :fountain_pen: Mahmoud Gharib
I have completed my education in community colleges with a focus on computer science, and have taken advanced courses in mathematics at the high school level. This education has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science, programming languages and mathematical concepts that are essential for software development.

I have expertise in various programming languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. I also have a basic understanding of Python, which I have used in some personal projects. My skills in these programming languages have been honed through various courses and personal projects, and I am confident that I can put them to good use in a professional environment.

In terms of frameworks, I have experience with Angular, Laravel, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Nest.js, and Figma. I have used these frameworks in various personal projects, and I am confident in my ability to use them effectively in a professional setting.

I am also a fast learner and can adapt to new technologies quickly. I am eager to take on new challenges and believe that I would be a valuable asset to your team. I am excited about the opportunity to work with and learn from experienced developers, and to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to your projects.
